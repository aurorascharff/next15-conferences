# Next.js 15 Account Selector

An interactive, accessible, responsive, account selector built with Next.js 15, React 19 features, Ariakit, Sonner, Tailwind CSS v4 and Prisma. It's been purposely slowed down to showcase the handling of loading state.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Prisma Setup

You need decide between prisma local development with `sqlite` or a real database with for example `postgresql` or `sqlserver`. Define it in the `schema.prisma` file.

Consider adding a `.env` file to the root of the project and use the environment variables inside `schema.prisma` with `env("DATABASE_URL")`, refer to `.env.sample`.

When using sqlite, initialize the database with:

```bash
npm run prisma.push
```

Seed prisma/seed.ts for initial data:

```sh
npm run prisma.seed
```

To view your data in the database, you can run:

```bash
npm run prisma.studio
```

When using a real database with for example postgresql or sqlserver, you need to migrate the database schema with:

```bash
npm run prisma.migrate
```
